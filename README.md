## Introduction

### What is SOC?

In today’s cyberthreat-infested landscape, customers demand honesty and transparency in how you handle their sensitive data. They’ll knock on your door with audit requests, questionnaires, and ad hoc inquiries seeking to unravel how secure, vigilant, and resilient your organization is. 

The System and Organizations Control (SOC) offers the best way to demonstrate effective information technology controls. 

The SOC report assures user entities that:

- You have the required security controls in place to protect customer data against known and emerging threats 
- You've set up alerts to detect anomalies and violations across the entire ecosystem easily
- Besides preventing risk situations, you can quickly repair damage and restore normalcy in case a rare data breach or system failure occurs
